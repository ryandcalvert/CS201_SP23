CS201 Programming 1 Spring 2023 student projects

The files and projects in this folder are from the CS201 Programming 1 students Spring 2023. This was the first semester of programming at Tabor College in several years. 

Students were given two projects to complete by the end of the semester: 
1. Creation or Modification of a stand alone program.
   For this assignment students could write a unique program with a GUI or modify (with annotations) the code of an existing program found online. The students were required to use/identify several different functions within the code. Finally, the code had to function the way they intended (they identified their goal prior to starting the project).
2. Ask a question of a dataset that interested them and do some basic data cleanup and analysis of the data. Students used public datasets or free data from user based sites. Any data code will have a minimum of a website to reference the original data.

These files are meant to showcase the students abilities by the end of the class.
